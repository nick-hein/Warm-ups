import datetime

#get user birthday
year = int(input('When is your birthday? [YY] '))
month = int(input('When is your birthday? [MM] '))
day = int(input('When is your birthday? [DD] '))
birthday = datetime.datetime(year,month,day)

#calculate days until birthday
now = datetime.datetime.now()
user_birthday = datetime.datetime(now.year, month, day)
difference = user_birthday - now
print(difference.days)
